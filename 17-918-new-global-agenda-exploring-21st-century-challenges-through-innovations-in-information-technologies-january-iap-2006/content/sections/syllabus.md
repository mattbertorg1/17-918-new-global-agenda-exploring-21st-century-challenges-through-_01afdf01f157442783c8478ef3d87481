Lectures: 3-Week Workshop: 2-3 sessions / week, 3 hours / session

Purpose
-------

This workshop is designed to introduce students to different perspectives on international politics in the 21st century. Students will explore how advances in information technology are changing international relations and global governance through opening new channels of communication, creating new methods of education, and new potentials for democratization. We will consider the positive and negative externalities associated with applications of such technologies. Students will be encouraged to look at alternative futures, and/or to frame solutions to problems that they define. The class will include guest lectures, discussions, and a final project and presentation.

Students are expected to come to all classes, participate, and complete all assignments. Students will be expected to cite works used and referenced in their work. If you do work with other students, please include their names.

Grading

Grading is based on two course assignments and a final project. Each represents one third of a student's course grade.
